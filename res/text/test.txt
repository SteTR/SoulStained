YOUR SHIP WAS WRECKED IN THE STORM
YOU WERE SAFELY WASHED ASHORE
ON NECROMANCERS ISLAND CASTLE 

TWAS ONCE A BEAUTIFUL AND PEACEFUL TOWN
INHABITED BY A GOOD NATURED PEOPLE
NOW CORRUPTED BY SIN LIES AND DECEIT

RAISED FROM THEIR MORTAL GRAVES
ZOMBIES ROAM ABOUT THE ISLAND TERRORIZING
THE REMAINING HUMAN INHABITANTS

THERE IS NO WAY OUT
DEFEAT THE NECROMANCER OR PERISH

USE WSAD FOR MOVEMENT
USE J AND K FOR ATTACKS
